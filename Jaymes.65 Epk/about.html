    <h2>About Me – Jaymes65</h2>
    <p>I’m <strong>Jaymes T Manyange</strong>, professionally known as <strong>Jaymes65</strong>—a DJ, creative, and storyteller through sound. From the first time I stood behind the decks, I knew I wasn’t just here to play music—I was here to craft moments.</p>

    <p>Over the past <strong>three years</strong>, I’ve brought electrifying energy to stages across clubs, festivals, lounges, and private events. Every performance is more than just a playlist—it’s an experience, a vibe, a connection.</p>

    <h3>My Style</h3>
    <p>At the heart of my sound is <strong>Afro House</strong>, but I blend it with <strong>Deep House</strong>, <strong>Afro Tech</strong>, <strong>Amapiano</strong>, and even <strong>Hip Hop</strong>. Each set is unique—tailored to the moment and the energy of the crowd.</p>

    <h3>Where I Started</h3>
    <p>My journey began in <strong>2022</strong> in <strong>Centurion, Gauteng</strong>, playing small local gigs. With time, passion, and dedication, I’ve grown to perform at respected venues like <strong>Cubana Fourways</strong>,<strong>News Café Mall@55</strong>, <strong>African Chef</strong>, <strong>News Cafe Cresta</strong>,<strong>R55 ChillOut</strong> and <strong>The Palms Backyard</strong>.</p>

    <h3>My Mission</h3>
    <p>I don’t just mix songs—I tell stories through rhythm. My sets are intentional, emotional, and unforgettable. I want people to leave feeling something real.</p>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>I’m inspired by legends like <strong>Black Coffee</strong>, <strong>Caiiro</strong>, <strong>Da Capo</strong>, and <strong>DJ Lag</strong>, and I’m building something of my own: a sound, a brand, and a legacy that speaks to Africa and the world.</p>
