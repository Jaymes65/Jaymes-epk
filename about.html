    <h2>About Me – Jaymes65</h2>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Jaymes T Manyange</strong>, professionally known as <strong>Jaymes65</strong>—a DJ, creative, and storyteller through sound. From the first time I stood behind the decks, I knew I wasn’t just here to play music—I was here to craft moments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past <strong>three years</strong>, I’ve brought electrifying energy to stages across clubs, festivals, lounges, and private events. Every performance is more than just a playlist—it’s an experience, a vibe, a connection.
    </p>

    <h3>My Style</h3>
    <p>
      At the heart of my sound is <strong>Afro House</strong>, but I blend it with <strong>Deep House, Afro Tech, Amapiano</strong>, and even <strong>Hip Hop</strong>. Each set is unique—tailored to the moment and the energy of the crowd.
    </p>

    <h3>Where I Started</h3>
    <p>
      My journey began in <strong>2022</strong> in <strong>Centurion, Gauteng</strong>, playing small local gigs. With time, passion, and dedication I’ve grown to perform at respected venues like <strong>Cubana Fourways, News Café Mall@55, African Chef, News Café Cresta, R55 ChillOut</strong> and <strong>The Palms Backyard</strong>.
